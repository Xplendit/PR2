1.**Task 3 step 2:** 

As soon as you press the Enter key, Cisco IOS debug output informs you that there is now a route, but its
state is False. In other words, the route has not yet been added to the routing table. Why did this occur
and what steps should be taken to ensure that the route is entered into the routing table? **no shutdown**

2.**Task 3 step 3:**

1. Check your physical connections to the LAN interface.
Is the correct interface attached? **yes** 
Your router may have more than one LAN interface. Did you connect the correct LAN interface?
**yes**
An interface will not come up unless it detects a carrier detect signal at the Physical layer from
another device. Is the interface connected to another device such as a hub, switch, or PC?
**yes**

2. Check link lights. Are all link lights blinking? **yes**
3. Check the cabling. Are the correct cables connected to the devices? **yes**
4. Has the interface been activated or enabled? **yes**

3.**Task 3 step 6**

Some IOS versions display the output shown above every 30 seconds. Why is the state of the route still
False? What step must you now take to make sure that the interface is fully configured? **no shutdown**

4.**Task 3 step 9:**

1. Check your physical connections to the LAN interface.
Is the correct interface attached? **yes** 
Your router may have more than one LAN interface. Did you connect the correct LAN interface?
**yes**
An interface will not come up unless it detects a carrier detect signal at the Physical layer from
another device. Is the interface connected to another device such as a hub, switch, or PC?
**yes**

2. Check link lights. Are all link lights blinking? **yes**
3. Check the cabling. Are the correct cables connected to the devices? **yes**
4. Has the interface been activated or enabled? **yes**

5.**Task 6 step 1**

1. Check the cabling.
Are the PCs physically connected to the correct router? **yes**
(Connection could be through a switch or directly)
Are link lights blinking on all relevant ports? **yes**
2. Check the PC configurations. Do they match the Topology Diagram? **yes**
3. Check the router interfaces using the show ip interface brief command.
Are all relevant interfaces up and up? **yes**

1. Check the cabling.
Are the routers physically connected? **yes**
Are link lights blinking on all relevant ports? **yes**
2. Check the router configurations.
Do they match the Topology Diagram? **yes**
Did you configure the clock rate command on the DCE side of the link? **yes**
3. Has the interface been activated or enabled? **yes**
4. Check the router interfaces using the show ip interface brief command.
Are the interfaces up and up? **yes**
